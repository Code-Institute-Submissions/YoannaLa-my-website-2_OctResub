# Testing
## Validator testing

* CSS - No errors were found when passing through the offical (jigsaw) validator

### Functionality testing
* I've used the chrome developers tools to test and solving problems with style, links and responsiveness

### Compatibility testing
* I've tested the website across few different devices and browsers, I coudn't work out the media for a phone to sort out the Contact Us title. Would love to find out the right way to do it. 
* I've used this website to check responsives of my website (http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)

### Issues found during site development
* I had a few issues with devloping this side, took me ages to sort out the form, only today (31.07) I've realised that there wee a videos on gitpod, all this time i was relaying on google and friends help... Lesson learn.
* I had an issue with the contact form on the last page - The "container" hasn't fit a mobile sized screen. I have now removed the "with" option in css file for the full screen. I've added 2 functions margin and with at 80% of the screen. Also the "Contact us". I have fixed that issue with 'inspect' function and play around the "container" size and location for my form. I wanted the form to be in the middle of the small screen (mobile) so set up the margins and correct size. Also since the form is located on the image, I've ajusted the size of tge image too.

* My schedule page - I really wanted to make it week by week and have at least a month with buttons next and previous, but my skills are not there yet.
